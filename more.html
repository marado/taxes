<br/>This is the example where you're taxing 100%, my <a href="proposal.html">scenario</a> is much more friendly, but as you can see the curve is pretty identical, only more accentuated. Also, notice that I zoomed out 4x, so you can see that even earning obscene ammounts, with 100% tax, you'll never manage to get more than three times the legal monthly minimum wage.
	<table id="data"></table>
	<script>
		// some definitions I might want to change, regarding how heavy I want this to be...
		var max_monthly_wage =  48000; // don't really need to look above that, do I?
		var monthly_resolution =  800; // the smaller they are, the heavier this is
		var tax = 1;

		var elem = document.getElementById("data"); 
		elem.innerHTML=proposal(max_monthly_wage, monthly_resolution, tax);
