<br/>This is how I think taxes would be fair. If you want to compair with what's going to be in 2012, <a href="index.html">here it is</a>.
<br/>Notice that in this scenario there are no "bumps", everything's progressive and fluid. And it is no matter how much we want to tax <a href="more.html">more</a> or <a href="less.html">less</a>... because this model is trivially simple: everyone pays the same tax. 
	<table id="data"></table>
	<script>
		// some definitions I might want to change, regarding how heavy I want this to be...
		var max_monthly_wage =  12000; // don't really need to look above that, do I?
		var monthly_resolution =  200; // the smaller they are, the heavier this is
		var tax = 0.48;

		var elem = document.getElementById("data"); 
		elem.innerHTML=proposal(max_monthly_wage, monthly_resolution, tax);
