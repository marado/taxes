<br/>This shows you what's going to happen. Point your mouse to each point in the graph to know more details. 
<br/>You are only seeing the first half of the graphic. While it gives you more detail, you might prefer <a href="index.html">more prespective</a>.
<br/>This only shows you the people who gets less than the minimum monthly wage. Notice that theres a point in the graph where if you earn more, you end up with less. See another view of this first part, but a little <a href="zoom.html">zoomed out</a>.

		var monthly_resolution =   5; // the smaller they are, the heavier this is

		var elem = document.getElementById("data");
